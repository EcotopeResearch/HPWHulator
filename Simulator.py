class Simulator:
    """
    Simulator class runs a simplified simulation to check the primary and swing
    tank systems.

    This class will run the primary simulation (schematic = "primary") or
    primary with swing tank simulation (schematic = "swingtank"). Both are run
    on a minute timestep to approximate the available storage volume in the
    primary system and the average tank temperature in the swing tank, if
    applicable.

    The primary system is run assuming the system is perfectly stratified and
    all of the hot water above the
    cold temperature line is at the storage temperature. Each time step some
    hot water is removed and some added according to the inputs.

    The swing tank is run assuming that the swing tank is well mixed and can
    be tracked by the average tank temperature
    and that the system loses the recirculation loop losses as a constant Watts.
    Since the swing tank is in series with the primary system the temperature
    needs to be tracked to inform inputs for primary step, unlike the parallel
    loop tank which is separated from the primary system.

    The swing tank is also assumed to have an 8 Â°F deadband from the swing
    heating trigger temperature.

    Examples
    --------
    An example usage to simulate a swing tank system:

    First make sure the hot water draws are in gpm. For examples starting with
    gph for each hour of the day,
    a list can be converted to gpm for each minute oof the day following:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from cfg import HRLIST_to_MINLIST
    >>> D_hw_gph = [ 27, 12, 8, 8, 24, 40, 74, 87, 82, 67, 40, 34, 29, 27,
                    29, 34, 40, 48, 51, 55, 59, 51, 38, 36]

    >>> D_hw_gpm = np.array(HRLIST_to_MINLIST(D_hw_gph)) / 60


    Then the simulator can be imported and initilized, with the desired inputs.


    >>> from HPWHsizer import Simulator
    >>> hpwhsim = Simulator(G_hw = [64]*24*60,
                            D_hw = D_hw_gpm,
                            V0 = 300,
                            Vtrig = 180,
                            Tcw = 50,
                            Tstorage = 150,
                            Tsupply = 120,
                            schematic = "swingtank",
                            swing_V0 = 80,
                            swing_Ttrig = 121,
                            Qrecirc_W = 2700,
                            Swing_Elem_kW = 5 )

    And then in order to find proper for the system in the order of primary
    storage volume, primary heating capacity, temperature maintenance storage
    volume, temperature maintenance heating capacity:
